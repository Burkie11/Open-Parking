# Open Parking

This Node.js app helps you find parking in Australia's most liveable city, Melbourne!

Thanks to the City of Melbourne's awesome [data portal](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/), this web application hooks into the city's [On-street Parking bay sensors API](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/On-street-Parking-Bay-Sensors/vh2v-4nfs) and shows you where there is on street parking avalable. 

The data is mapped thanks to Google's [Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) and it's [Direction Service API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions) to bring the you a rich visualisation and even provides directions to closest open parking spot.

The website is live at [open-parking.com/](https://open-parking.com/) and is hosted on [Zeit's Now service](https://zeit.co/now)
